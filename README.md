This prject displays list of movies from a local api exposed via express.js and provides functionality to filter components based on genre (multiselect) and input search by movie title.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, 

to start the backend server, open terminal and run following commands :

### `cd movies-server`
### `npm i`
### `npm start`

This will start the backend sever on port 8000 and expose the `/movies` api.

to start the front end application, open a new terminal and run following commands :

### `cd ..`
### `npm i`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
